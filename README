This is the summary of data used in following paper:

Yue et al. 2020. Afforestation increases ecosystem productivity and carbon storage in China during the 2000s (submitted to AFM)

All the data are simulated using YIBs vegetation model at 0.2x0.2 resolution, and consist of 8 variables including (see Yue et al. 2020):
GPP                 Gross primary productivity
NPP                 Net primary productivity
NEP                 Net ecosystem productivity
NBP                 Net biospheric Productivity
LAI                 Leaf area index
Ra                  Autotrophic respiration
Rh                  Heterotrophic respiration
Carbon_total        Total land carbon

In total, 10 experiments are performed including: 
YIBs_merra_all_c05.nc.tar.gz              Forced with year-to-year MERRA met, CO2, and LCC from MODIS C05 land cover
